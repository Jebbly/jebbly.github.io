Hi! I am a first-year PhD student at UCSD advised by [Professor Ravi Ramamoorthi](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/) and supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program). My current research focuses on Monte Carlo algorithms for real-time light transport simulation. More broadly, I'm also interested in probability theory, , and human perception.

I graduated from UIUC in 2025 with a B.S. in mathematics and computer science, and a minor in physics. As an undergrad, I was fortunate to work with many wonderful research mentors. Since my freshman year, I have been working with [Professor Sarita Adve](https://sadve.cs.illinois.edu/) in the [ILLIXR Group](https://illixr.org/), building power-efficient XR rendering systems. In Summer 2024 and 2025, I interned at [NVIDIA's Real-Time Graphics Research Group](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/) led by [Dr. Aaron Lefohn](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/author/aaron-lefohn/), researching ReSTIR under the guidance of [Dr. Chris Wyman](https://cwyman.org/), [Dr. Daqi Lin](https://dqlin.xyz/), [Dr. Markus Kettunen](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/author/markus-kettunen/), and [Professor Ravi Ramamoorthi](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/). I also worked on differentiable rendering topics with [Professor Shuang Zhao](https://shuangz.com/).
