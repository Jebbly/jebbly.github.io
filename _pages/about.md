Hi! I am a fourth-year student at UIUC, pursuing a major in mathematics and computer science with a minor in physics. Broadly speaking, my interests include real-time rendering, physics-based simulation and animation, and human perception. I also enjoy building scalable graphics systems and exploring how insights from traditional graphics can be applied to artificial intelligence (and vice versa).

As an undergrad, I had the great fortune to work with wonderful research mentors. Since my freshman year, I have been working with [Professor Sarita Adve](https://sadve.cs.illinois.edu/) in the [ILLIXR Group](https://illixr.org/), building power-efficient XR rendering systems. In Summer 2024, I interned at [NVIDIA's Real-Time Graphics Research Group](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/), led by [Dr. Aaron Lefohn](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/author/aaron-lefohn/), to research ReSTIR with [Dr. Chris Wyman](https://cwyman.org/), [Dr. Daqi Lin](https://dqlin.xyz/), [Dr. Markus Kettunen](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/author/markus-kettunen/), and [Professor Ravi Ramamoorthi](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/). I also studied differentiable rendering under the guidance of [Professor Shuang Zhao](https://shuangz.com/).

Starting Fall 2025, I will be a PhD student at UCSD advised by [Professor Ravi Ramamoorthi](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/).
