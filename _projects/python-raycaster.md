This raycasting engine was my first "large" programming project to formalize my experience with Python, and is primarily based on [F. Permadi's set of tutorials](https://permadi.com/1996/05/ray-casting-tutorial-table-of-contents/). It's not particularly performant, or fully featured, outside of some textures that I proudly created myself :) Nevertheless, I would consider this project my first taste of computer graphics, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/python-raycaster/sample-thumbnail.jpg" title="Sample Screenshot" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Although raycasting with a 2D grid isn't too common nowadays (as far as I'm aware), it made me appreciate the type of math involved and definitely whet my appetite for more. In retrospect, I think that tutorial series was a great beginner project.

The code isn't very interesting, but it's all on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jebbly/Python-Raycaster) to play around with.
